# My-Portfolio
once I started building this site, I started from scratch. Three files were created, which are porfolio, index, and contact. Each file of these represents one different page we go to using the navigation bar that was built in each one of these page.
I started with the index, which consisted of title, heading, body, and footer. It contains the bio of Mohammed Arafat (me) with some external links of his work. I made sure each link of those works 100%.
The second page is the portfolio, which consists of five photos of me. Ttile, heading, footer were inlcluded too. 
The third file, which is the contact, was the easiest since bootstraps helped a lot in building it. It consisted of my contact information. 
The footer style and color, navigation bar style and color  and the background color of each page are the same.
While working on some tiny elements, it was a little complicated and confusing to include in-line styles, so I created an external file, which is style.css to help build these elements. 
Each page is connected to the style sheet, the bootstraps site and consists of scrip links to give the website an overall design.
Each page of the three pages is responsive. I tried openning them all using different devices, and they worked almost perfectly. Media queries are minimized as much as I could.
Different fonts are added from google fonts.
